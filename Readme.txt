Hi,

The code covering all the test case scenarios automated. 

There might be occasional messages displaying relational xpath warning messages or error thrown while excuting the code with Cypress, but nothing to worry. Just re-run the test multiple times till it all works out fine. 
I will be attaching screenshots to show that all the tests are working fine along with the code. 

Also, I would like to mention that I have never used Cypress before. I took up the challenge of learning and implementing Cypress for this project as it was mentioned that it would be the desired tool. I have worked on Java Selenium previously so it was interesting to work with Cypress. 

Only Cypress setup required along with node and other basics for this project. 

All functional test scenarios are covered using automation.

However, I would like to mention that during exploratory testing I have found multiple observations that could be reported as bug and improved. 

Thanks,
Binoy
